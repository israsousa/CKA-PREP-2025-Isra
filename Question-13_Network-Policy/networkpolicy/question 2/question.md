# Question 17 – NetworkPolicy (Frontend ↔ Backend) | CKA Exam Style

## Context

There are two applications deployed in **separate namespaces**:

- **frontend** namespace → frontend application
- **backend** namespace → backend application

Both applications are already deployed and **must communicate with each other**.

⚠️ Currently, communication is **blocked** due to existing restrictive NetworkPolicies.
